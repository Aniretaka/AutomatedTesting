One example is that they would not be able to run the full range of third-party watch apps, limiting an owner's ability to customise their wearable to the same degree they could if they owned an Android phone. However, it is worth noting that Apple does not allow any third-party watch faces to be installed on its own smartwatch.?
Other limitations include an inability to reply to text messages via an Android Watch, and the fact it cannot be used to search for a specific song in Apple's Music service - popular functions that Apple's own smartwatch can do..
The move greatly increases the potential market for the devices, and could pose a challenge to the Apple Watch itself
